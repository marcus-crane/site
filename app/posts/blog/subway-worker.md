# I'm a subway worker

I **love** sandwiches. Just can't get enough of them.

I'm also a fan of fixing trains

| Item       | $   |
| ---------- | --- |
| Foot Long  | $10 |
| Train Pass | $10 |

Now which kind of subway worker am I? Retail or mechanical?

I sometimes do coding too

```python
print('Hello World!')
```
